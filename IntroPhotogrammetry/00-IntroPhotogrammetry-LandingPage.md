[Photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) enables the **digital reconstruction of three-dimensional objects** using information extracted from flat imagery and applying optics and projective geometry methods to keep realistic dimensions. Although the origins of the technique date back to the nineteenth century, modern digitization and computing power have made photogrammetry widely used. Among the fields of applications are archaeology, architecture, and engineering to digitally reconstruct cultural heritage, report construction progress, and investigate quality control, respectively. It is also employed in criminology, meteorology, and modern movie-making. Another major sector of application is **agriculture**, where processing aerial imagery enables the mapping of land areas and **monitoring of crops**.
