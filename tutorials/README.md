# Tutorials

Can place jupyter notebook files here. Use the `jupyter_to_md.sh` script to convert the notebooks into Markdown files for the workbook.

```{bash}
bash jupyter_to_md.sh Tutorial1_Image_Processing_Essentials.ipynb
# Will generate Tutorial1_Image_Processing_Essentials.md
```

Remember to double check the following repos for updates. Notebook files are probably in the `tutorials` folder, also double check the repo branches.
